## Usage

Quite simple : when on a DuckDuckGo result page, just press `Alt+g` to go to the Google results page for the same query.

## Installation

As this is a user script, you have to install the ad hoc browser extension first :

- Firefox users, install [Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/scriptish/)
- Chrome/Chromium users, install [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/scriptish/)

Then, just visit the user script URL :

## Motivation

As I am quite lazy, having to type `h` `!g ` `Return` each time I wanted to go to a Google results page from DuckDuckGo was way too tiresome.
